            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Nuzzled in the east between India, China and Pakistan lies 
                one of the most interesting glaciers in all of the world. “The world's highest battlefield”, the second largest mountain glacier or the Siachen Glacier one that has sparked conflict and dispute yet holds tremendous beauty at the same time. Due to human impact, the glacier is shrinking which could prove for the civilians underneath and the many that depend on it. </p>

            <h2>The Battles:</h2>
            <p>The Siachen Glacier has been a source of conflict for many years. A war between Pakistan and India was started in the 1980s due to a land dispute between the two countries. It started in a collective misunderstanding of “Karachi” and “Simla” agreements which had unclear mention on which nation owned the glacier. The more subdued but important reason for the fight in such a bad area is if Indias control of the region remains, they can keep Landakh (The region the glaciers are in). The area of the Siachen Glacier is a very harsh and unkind environment which proved ill-fated for the soldiers involved. Throughout this period, a whopping ~2000 soldiers were eliminated from the fight by the conditions whether they were frostbite or avalanches. In one unfortunate draw of fate on April 7th, 2012, 135 people were swept away in the Gyari avalanche leaving 124 to be missing due to the strike being on a military base. In another 4 scouts were killed, in another 10 soldiers dead. Overall there were more fatalities due to the environment rather than by lead.  </p>

            <h2>Environmental Impact:</h2>
            <p>With the military action being outgoing in Siachen, the strain that the battles take on the glaciers takes a heavy toll on people underneath. This presence also puts a strain on the neighbouring glaciers which could lead to more flooding of the Ganges, Chenab and Sutlej rivers. Sofar, the Siachen Glacier has already been shortened and retreated by around 6km. This causes flooding of village banks in the summer which not only affects their population but their crops. This flooding increases the minimum and maximum temperatures all throughout Pakistan therefore changing the onset of winter's end and by this the crop yield, size and quality. With a total of the village's rough population being around 20 000 which seems like not a lot, this crop situation impacts a lot more people than originally it leads on seeing that Pakistan and India’s food exports are worth billions to not be hyperbolic. If people don't have access to food and water then people starve. Simple as that. </p>
